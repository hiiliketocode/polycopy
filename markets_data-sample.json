This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Applied Materials reports non-GAAP EPS greater than $2.10 for the relevant quarter in its next quarterly earnings release. Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No.\" The resolution source will be the non-GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents. \n\nIf Applied Materials releases earnings without non-GAAP EPS, then the market will resolve according to the non-GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha. If no such figure is published within 96h of market close (4:00:00pm ET) on the day earnings are announced, the market will resolve according to the GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents; or, if not published there, according to the GAAP EPS provided by SeekingAlpha. If no GAAP EPS number is available from either source at that time, the market will resolve to “No.” (For the purposes of this market, GAAP EPS refers to diluted GAAP EPS, unless it is not published, in which case it refers to basic GAAP EPS.)\n\nIf the company does not release earnings within 45 calendar days of the estimated earnings date, this market will resolve to “No.” \n\nNote: Subsequent restatements, corrections, or revisions made to the initially announced non-GAAP EPS figure will not qualify for resolution, except in the case of obvious and immediate mistakes (e.g., fat finger errors, as with Lyft's (LYFT) earnings release in February 2024).\nNote: The strike prices used in these markets are derived from SeekingAlpha estimates, and reflect the consensus of sell-side analyst estimates for non-GAAP EPS.\nNote: All figures will be rounded to the nearest cent using standard rounding.\nNote: For the purposes of this market, IFRS EPS will be treated as GAAP EPS.\nNote: If multiple versions of non-GAAP EPS are published, the market will resolve according to the primary headline non-GAAP EPS number, which is typically presented on a diluted basis. If diluted is not published, then basic non-GAAP EPS will qualify.\nNote: All figures are expressed in USD, unless otherwise indicated.\nNote: For primarily internationally listed companies, this market refers specifically to the shares traded in the United States on U.S. stock exchanges such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. In cases where the company trades in the U.S. through an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) or American Depositary Share (ADS), this market will refer to the ADR/ADS.\n",

    "description": "This market will resolve according to the person/thing named the Financial Times' Person of the Year for 2025.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the listed person is named the Financial Times' Person of the Year either alone or in conjunction with any other person or thing which is not named in this market, so long as the term is explicitly named.\n\nFor example, if the Person of the Year is \"Donald Trump and the MAGA movement\", this would qualify to resolve this market to “Trump”. However, if the Person of the Year is \"The MAGA movement\", this would not qualify to resolve this market to “Trump” regardless of whether Trump is depicted or discussed by the Financial Times.\n\nIf two or more people or things that are named in this market are named the Financial Times' Person of the Year, this market will resolve in favor of whichever person or thing is listed first. For example, if the Financial Times' Person of the Year is “Ugur Sahin & Özlem Türeci”, the market for Ugur Sahin would resolve to “Yes,” and the market for Özlem Türeci would resolve to “No”.\n\nThis market will resolve based on the Financial Times' official Person of the Year publication, not on any other FT articles that differ from the primary Person of the Year feature.\n\nThis market can resolve after the 2025 Financial Times Person of the Year is announced by the Financial Times. If, for any reason, the 2025 Financial Times Person of the Year is not announced by January 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"Other\".\n\nNote: this event is mutually exclusive.",

    "description": "On January 24, President Trump announced that the United States would apply a 100% tariff to all imports from Canada if a trade deal with China goes through. (see: https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-threatens-canada-with-100-tariff-over-possible-deal-with-china-2026-01-24/).\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if a general 100% tariff rate or higher on imports into the United States from Canada goes into effect for any amount of time by June 30, 2026, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nOnly tariffs specifically targeting Canada will qualify. For example, a new global tariff (tariffs on all imports into the U.S.) will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nFor the purpose of this market, \"goes into effect\" means the start date of the tariffs (as set by legislation or executive action) must have passed without being further delayed or suspended. Only tariffs which are in effect will qualify. Tariffs which are paused, or which have been announced but not yet gone into effect will not be considered.\n\nThe general tariff rate refers to the base tariff rate paid on imports, including any general tariff the U.S. imposes on all imports (e.g. a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 50% tariff on top of that on Canadian imports would equal a 60% tariff). Item specific exceptions or increases will not be considered (i.e. this market does not refer to the effective tariff rate).\n\nA general tariff that includes item specific exceptions will still qualify, as long as a policy of a general 100% tariff on all imports into the United States from Canada is in effect.\n\nThis market's primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration; however, a consensus of credible information will also be used.",

    "title": "Will Trump say \"Merry Christmas\" during the Hanukkah Reception event on Tuesday?",
    "description": "Donald Trump is scheduled to participate in an event titled \"The President participates in a Hanukkah Reception\" in Washington on December 16, 2025, 8:15PM ET (see https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/calendar/).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump says the listed term during his appearance at the specified event. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nPluralization/possessive of the listed term will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nInstances where the term is used in a compound word will count regardless of context (e.g. joyful is not a compound word for \"joy,\" however \"killjoy\" is a compounding of the words \"kill\" and \"joy\").\n\nIf this market requires a specified number of mentions of a person’s first or last name, a full-name mention will count as one mention (e.g., if a market is about “Joe / Biden 5+ times,” a mention of “Joe Biden” will count once).\n\nAI-generated audio or video will not count toward this market's resolution.\n\nThis market is explicitly about the scheduled event titled \"The President participates in a Hanukkah Reception\" on December 16, 2025, 8:15PM ET (https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/topic/calendar/). Speeches, events, or comments that occur outside of the named, scheduled event will not qualify toward this market's resolution. If the event contains a Q&A, it will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nIf this event is definitively cancelled, or otherwise is not aired by December 16, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be video of the events. Only remarks which are broadcast or streamed live will count toward this market's resolution.",

    "description": "Donald Trump has scheduled a rally on October 31 in Albuquerque, New Mexico (see: https://event.donaldjtrump.com/events/president-donald-j-trump-to-hold-a-rally-in-albuquerque-new-mexico).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Trump says \"border\" 30 or more times during their appearance at this event. Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nAny usage of the term regardless of context will count toward the resolution of this market.\n\nPluralization/possessive of the term will count toward the resolution of this market, however other forms will NOT count.\n\nCompound words will count as long as \"border\" is part of the compound word and references the meaning which refers to a political boundary between nations.\n\nIf this candidate does not appear at this event, or if the event is otherwise cancelled or delayed beyond October 31, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nThe resolution source will be the video of the speech.\n",

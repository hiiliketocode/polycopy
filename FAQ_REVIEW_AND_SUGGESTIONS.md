## 🔍 Accuracy Review: Potential Issues to Verify

### Items to Double-Check:

1. **"one click (premium)" still appears in one location (line 29)**

   - Some places may still reference old tab name
   - Status: ✅ Appears fixed

3. **Auto-Close availability**
   - Answer says "during a Quick Trade" - confirm this is accurate
   - If it's only available DURING trade setup, this is correct
   - If users can enable it after the fact, needs clarification
   - Status: ❓ Verify with product team

4. **Wallet disconnection on cancellation**
   - Updated to say automatic disconnect - this was confirmed correct
   - Status: ✅ Verified

5. **Premium requirement for trade execution**

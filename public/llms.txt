# Polycopy - Smart Copy Trading for Polymarket

> Curated feed of trades from top Polymarket traders. Pick what to copy, maintain control, learn from the best.

## Product Overview

Polycopy is a copy trading platform for Polymarket that emphasizes **curation over automation**. Unlike traditional copy trading tools that blindly copy every trade from a selected trader, Polycopy provides a curated feed approach—similar to Twitter for trading—where users follow traders they trust, see their moves in real-time, and decide which trades to copy.

The platform helps traders make better decisions through informed curation, not blind automation. Users maintain full agency while benefiting from the insights of proven traders.

## Core Philosophy

**Curation > Automation**
- The best trading tools don't think for you—they help you think better
- Users maintain agency to pick and choose trades that align with their thesis
- Learning from top traders while still thinking for yourself
- Informed decision-making over blind following

## How It Works

1. **Follow Top Traders**: Browse and filter 500K+ Polymarket traders by ROI, win rate, P&L, trading history, and category expertise (Sports, Politics, Crypto, Pop Culture, Business & Finance, Economics, Tech, Weather)

2. **Get a Curated Feed**: See their trades as they happen in a clean, chronological feed—like Twitter for Polymarket trading

3. **Pick and Choose**: Decide which trades align with your thesis and risk tolerance. You're not obligated to copy everything.

4. **Execute Trades**: Copy manually (free tier) or with one-click execution (premium tier)

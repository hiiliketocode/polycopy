## 2. Getting Started Section (Add after account creation FAQ)

### **Do I need cryptocurrency experience to use Polycopy?**

**No cryptocurrency experience required!**

Polycopy is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of crypto knowledge:

**What You Need to Know:**
- **USDC is just digital dollars:** USDC is a stablecoin - $1 USDC = $1 USD. It's simply US dollars on the blockchain.
- **Simple funding:** You can buy USDC with a credit card directly on Polymarket - no crypto exchange needed
- **No gas fees:** Polymarket uses a "gasless" system, so you don't need to understand gas fees or hold other cryptocurrencies
- **Easy wallet:** Polymarket creates a wallet for you automatically when you sign up - no complex wallet setup

**Free Features Require Zero Crypto:**
- Browse traders, view statistics, and follow traders without any crypto or wallet
- Manual copy trading just requires clicking links - Polymarket handles the crypto part

**Premium Features Made Simple:**
- We guide you through connecting your wallet step-by-step
- Everything happens in your browser - no complicated downloads
- Your crypto stays safe with Turnkey's bank-level security

**Think of it like this:** Using Polycopy is more like following stock traders than trading cryptocurrency. The blockchain aspect is handled behind the scenes.

## 3. Copy Trading Section (Add after "How do I find traders to copy?")

### **How do I know which traders are good to follow?**

⚠️ **Important:** This is educational information only. Polycopy does not provide financial advice. Always do your own research and never risk more than you can afford to lose.

**Key Metrics to Evaluate:**

**1. Consistency Over Time**
- Look for traders profitable across **multiple time periods** (7d, 30d, all-time)
- Avoid traders with one lucky week followed by losses
- Check their trading history - how long have they been active?

**2. Return on Investment (ROI)**
- High ROI with low volume might be luck
- Moderate ROI (20-40%) with high volume often indicates skill
- Compare ROI across different timeframes for consistency

**3. Win Rate**
- A 60%+ win rate is generally solid
- Very high win rates (90%+) might indicate small position sizes or cherry-picking easy markets
- Balance win rate with average profit per trade

**4. Trading Volume**
- Higher volume shows the trader is actively engaged
- More trades = larger sample size to evaluate skill
- Look for at least 20-50 trades before following

**5. Market Categories**
- Does the trader specialize in markets you understand?
- Do they trade politics, sports, crypto, or a mix?
- Specialization in one category might indicate expertise

**6. Recent Performance**
- How have they performed in the last 7-30 days?
- Markets change - recent success matters more than ancient history

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- ❌ Traders with no recent activity (30+ days)
- ❌ Extreme volatility (massive wins followed by massive losses)
- ❌ Very few trades but high profits (likely luck, not skill)
- ❌ Trading only low-liquidity markets (harder to copy)

**Best Practice:**
- **Diversify** - Follow 3-5 traders, not just one
- **Start small** - Test copying with small amounts first
- **Monitor performance** - Review results weekly and adjust
- **Trust your judgment** - If something seems too good to be true, it probably is

**Remember:** Past performance does not guarantee future results. Every trader can have losing streaks.

## 4. Copy Trading Section (Add after "Can I manually sell my Quick Copied order?")

### **What's the difference between following and copying a trader?**

These are **two distinct actions** with different outcomes:

**Following a Trader:**
- **What it does:** Adds the trader to your personalized feed
- **What you see:** Their trades appear in your feed when they place them
- **Cost:** Free for all users
- **Trading:** You must manually decide whether to copy each trade
- **Use case:** Research traders, watch their activity, learn their strategy

**Think of following like:** Subscribing to someone on social media - you see their posts but don't automatically do what they do.

**Copying a Trade:**
- **What it does:** Actually executes the same trade with your funds
- **What happens:** You open a position on the same market/outcome
- **Cost:** Free tier = manual copy (you execute on Polymarket); Premium = Quick Copy (executed through Polycopy)
- **Trading:** You're now invested with real money
- **Use case:** Putting your money on the same trade as the trader

**Think of copying like:** Actually making the same investment - you have skin in the game.

**The Flow:**
1. **Follow** a trader → See their trades in your feed
2. **Decide** which trades to copy (don't have to copy everything)
3. **Copy** individual trades → Invest your money

**Important Notes:**
- Following does NOT automatically copy trades - you must manually copy each one
- You can follow unlimited traders for free
- You choose which trades to copy - you're not locked into copying everything
- Following lets you evaluate a trader before risking money

**Example:**
- You follow 10 traders (free)
- Their trades appear in your feed
- You manually copy 2 trades from Trader A today (your choice)
- You skip trades from the other 9 traders
- Tomorrow, you might copy different traders

---

## 5. Copy Trading Section (Add after "Following vs Copying" FAQ)

### **Can I copy multiple traders at once?**

**Yes! You can follow and copy as many traders as you want.**

**How it Works:**

**Following Multiple Traders:**
- Follow unlimited traders for free
- Their trades all appear in your unified feed
- Filter by trader, category, or time to manage your feed
- No limit on how many traders you can follow simultaneously

**Copying Multiple Trades:**
- **Free users:** Manually copy trades from as many traders as you want on Polymarket
- **Premium users:** Execute Quick Copy trades from multiple traders through Polycopy
- Each trade is independent - manage them separately in your portfolio
- No restriction on the number of active positions

**Best Practices for Multi-Trader Strategy:**

**1. Diversification:**
- Copy 3-5 traders with different specialties (politics, sports, crypto)
- Don't put all funds on one trader
- Spread risk across multiple strategies

**2. Position Sizing:**
- Set a maximum per-trade amount (e.g., $10-20 per copy)
- Never exceed your total risk tolerance across all copies
- Consider your wallet balance when copying multiple trades

**3. Organization:**
- Use the "Trades" tab on your profile to track all positions
- Monitor which traders are performing best for you
- Adjust your following list based on results

**4. Avoid Over-Copying:**
- Quality over quantity - don't copy every trade from every trader
- Be selective even with multiple traders
- Focus on markets you understand

**Example Strategy:**
- Follow: 10 traders across different categories
- Copy: 2-3 trades per day from your top performers
- Monitor: Check performance weekly
- Adjust: Unfollow underperformers, find new traders

**Premium Advantage:**
With Premium, you can:
- Quickly copy trades from different traders in seconds
- Set Auto-Close for positions across all traders
- Track all positions in one portfolio dashboard
- Execute faster before odds change

**Remember:** More traders ≠ better results. Focus on quality traders and selective copying.

## 7. Technical & General Section (Add after "How does Polycopy make money?")

### **How is Polycopy different from other copy trading platforms?**

Polycopy is purpose-built for **Polymarket prediction markets** with unique features you won't find elsewhere:

- **Open roadmap:** We share what we're building

**vs Traditional Copy Trading Platforms:**
| Feature | Polycopy | Traditional Platforms |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Market Type | Prediction Markets | Forex/Stocks/Crypto |
| Speed | Sub-second | Minutes to hours |
| Fees | $20/month flat | Per-trade + profit sharing |
| Security | Turnkey TEE/HSM | Varies (often centralized) |
| Transparency | Blockchain-verified | Platform-controlled |
| Specialization | Polymarket expert | Generalist |

**vs Manual Polymarket Trading:**

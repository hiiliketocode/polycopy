TASK:
1. SELECT 5 best trades (high excitement_score, variety, story potential)
2. RESEARCH those 5: market context, timing, trader stats, news
3. CREATE tweets (240-260 chars) using templates below
4. GENERATE Polycopy URLs: https://polycopy.app/trader/{wallet_address}

TWEET TEMPLATES:

1. The Missed Play:
[Trader] bet [token_label] on [market_title]. Entry: [price] Result: [outcome] ROI: +[roi_pct]%
[One-line context on edge/why smart]
Would you have made this call? ↓

2. The Timing Play:
[Trader] placed their bet [X min] before close. Market: [market_title]
Entry: [price] Result: [outcome] ROI: +[roi_pct]%
They saw something. How early do you enter? ↓

3. The Conviction Bet:
[Trader] put $[invested_usd] on [market_title]. Position: [token_label] at [price]
Result: +$[profit_usd] profit (+[roi_pct]% ROI)
[One-line on conviction]
Big bets. Big returns. ↓

4. The Contrarian:
[market_title] consensus: [XX%] said [outcome]. [Trader] bet the other side at [price]
Result: +[roi_pct]% ROI
The crowd was wrong. [One-line insight]
Do you fade or follow? ↓

5. The Sniper:
[Trader] bet [token_label] on [market_title] when it had [entry_price*100]% odds
Entry: [price] Result: [outcome] ROI: +[roi_pct]%
They bought when everyone thought impossible. Sometimes contrarians win big.
Did you see this one coming? ↓

RESEARCH PRIORITY:
- High: ROI, entry price, timing, profit dollars
- Medium: Market type, position size, win rate
- Low: Raw volume without ROI context

ENGAGEMENT HOOKS:
Questions: "Would you have made this call?", "Do you fade or follow?", "Did you see this one coming?"
Provocations: "The crowd was wrong.", "Easy money if you knew where to look.", "This is why timing matters."

AVOID:
- ALL CAPS, excessive emojis, hashtags
- Financial advice, guaranteed returns
- Corporate speak, influencer energy
- Links in main tweet (use reply thread)

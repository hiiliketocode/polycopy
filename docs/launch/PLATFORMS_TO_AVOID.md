# Platforms to AVOID - Launch Queue Issues

These platforms have unreasonably long wait times and are NOT worth your time.

---

## ❌ SKIP THESE

### LaunchIgniter
- **Wait Time**: 6 months (next slot: August 2026)
- **Hidden Cost**: Only "free" if you add their badge to your website
- **Verdict**: Not worth it. Skip completely.

### StartupsLab
- **Wait Time**: Requires badge on site OR payment
- **Hidden Cost**: Not actually free without badge
- **Verdict**: Skip. Not worth cluttering your site with badges.
- **Wait Time**: 7 months (next slot: September 2026)
- **Verdict**: Even worse than LaunchIgniter. Skip.

## ⚠️ Pattern Recognition

**The Problem**: Many "launch platforms" operate more like scheduled PR calendars. They:
- Queue launches months in advance
- Limit daily/weekly launch slots
- Require badges or premium to bypass queues
- Create artificial scarcity

**The Solution**: Focus on **directory-style platforms** that list you immediately upon approval, not launch platforms with scheduled dates.

## ✅ BETTER ALTERNATIVES

Focus on platforms that give **immediate visibility**:

### Directory Style (Immediate Listing)
1. **StartupsLab** - Immediate upon approval
2. **Toolfolio** - Directory listing, no queue
3. **Startup Stash** - Directory, no wait
4. **SaaSHub** - Immediate listing
5. **AlternativeTo** - Immediate upon approval

### Community Style (Post Anytime)
1. **Indie Hackers** - Post whenever you want
2. **Reddit** (r/SideProject, r/startups) - Instant
3. **Hacker News** (Show HN) - Instant
4. **Twitter/X** - Instant

### Curated But Fast (Days not months)
1. **BetaList** - Few days approval
2. **Uneed** - Quick approval
3. **DevHunt** - Fast turnaround
4. **Fazier** - Quick listing

## 🎯 Revised Focus

**OLD Strategy**: Submit to "launch platforms" and wait months
**NEW Strategy**: Submit to directories and communities for immediate visibility

**Time to Value**:
- ❌ LaunchIgniter: 6 months
- ❌ OpenLaunch: 7 months
- ✅ StartupsLab: 1-3 days
- ✅ Indie Hackers: Immediate
- ✅ Toolfolio: 1-2 days

**Lesson Learned**: Avoid any platform that schedules launches more than 2 weeks out. Your product needs visibility NOW, not in half a year.

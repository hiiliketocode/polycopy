## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Email verification required"
→ Check your email inbox/spam for verification link

### "Logo too large"
→ Use PNG version from `/public/logos/` - already optimized

### "Description too long"
→ Use "Short Description" from cheat sheet above

### "Category not found"
→ Try: Finance → Trading → SaaS → FinTech (in that order)

### "Submission pending approval"
→ Normal! Most platforms manually review. Check email in 24-48h.

### "Need to add badge to website"
→ See StartupsLab section in submission guides for HTML code

## 💬 Response Templates

Use these for common comments:

### "How is this different from [competitor]?"
```
Great question! Polycopy is specifically built for Polymarket with deep integration into their CLOB API. We focus on three things: real-time data, non-custodial security, and ease of use. You can start copying trades in under 3 minutes.
```

### "Is there a free tier?"
```
Yes! The free tier includes unlimited following, portfolio tracking, and manual trade copying. Premium ($20/mo) adds automated execution and auto-close functionality.
```

### "How do you make money?"
```
We operate on a freemium model. Free tier for manual copying, Premium subscription for automation. This aligns our incentives with users - we only win when you find value.
```

### "What about security?"
```
Security is our top priority. We're 100% non-custodial - you control your keys at all times. We use Turnkey for encrypted key management and never have access to your unencrypted keys.
```

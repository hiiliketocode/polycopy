Hi IH! 👋

I just launched Polycopy - a copy-trading platform for Polymarket (prediction markets).

## The Problem
Polymarket has 500K+ traders, but finding consistently profitable ones and manually copying their trades is tedious. By the time you spot a good trade, the opportunity has passed.

## The Solution
Polycopy curates top performers and enables instant trade copying - either manually (free) or automatically (premium).

## Key Features
• Browse 500K+ traders with full analytics
• Real-time trade notifications
• Auto-execution for Premium users
• 100% non-custodial security
• Portfolio tracking & PnL

## Tech Stack
Next.js 16, TypeScript, Supabase, Stripe, deployed on Vercel + Fly.io workers

## Pricing
Free tier: Manual copying, unlimited following
Premium ($20/mo): Automated execution, auto-close

## Traction
[Add your metrics here if you have them]

Would love feedback from the IH community! Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack, copy trading mechanics, or building in the prediction markets space.

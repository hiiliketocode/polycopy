**Day 3: Bulls, Bears, HFTs, and Hedgers—Which Strategy Wins?**

*Published: February 7, 2026 | 1 Day Until Kickoff*

---

## The Archetype Theory

Not all traders are created equal. After analyzing 100 elite Super Bowl traders, four distinct archetypes emerged—each with unique strategies, risk profiles, and win rates.

Understanding these archetypes matters because:
1. **You can identify which type YOU are**
2. **You can copy strategies that match your risk tolerance**
3. **You can spot when archetypes disagree (market inefficiency)**

Today we profile **19 HFT traders, 16 Bulls, 7 Bears, and 44 Hedgers**—and reveal which archetype has the best track record.

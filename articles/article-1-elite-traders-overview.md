# Super Bowl LX: What $26.6M in Elite Trader Activity Reveals About Seahawks vs Patriots

**The Smart Money Has Spoken — And It's Not Even Close**

*Published: February 5, 2026 | 3 Days Until Kickoff*

---

## The Setup

With Super Bowl LX just 72 hours away, Polymarket has become ground zero for the world's most liquid sports betting market—**$697 million in total volume** across all Super Bowl markets. But buried within this tsunami of trades is a signal most bettors miss: what are the elite traders doing?

We analyzed **99,370 trades worth $26.6 million** from Polymarket's top 100 Super Bowl traders. These aren't casual $10 bettors or weekend warriors—they're sophisticated market participants deploying six and seven-figure positions with surgical precision.

**The verdict?** It's not even close. Elite traders are **2:1 bullish on the Seattle Seahawks** (68% to win) over the New England Patriots (32%), with buy pressure so lopsided it's creating a legitimate contrarian opportunity on the Patriots side.

---

## The Numbers That Matter

Before we dive into specific traders, here's what $26.6M in elite volume tells us:

### Seahawks Markets
- **BUY Volume:** $10.8M (67.4%)
- **SELL Volume:** $5.2M (32.6%)
- **Net Pressure:** +$5.6M bullish
- **Signal:** 🚀 **STRONG BUY**

### Patriots Markets  
- **BUY Volume:** $4.5M (54.8%)
- **SELL Volume:** $3.7M (45.2%)
- **Net Pressure:** +$794K bullish
- **Signal:** ⚖️ **NEUTRAL** (used as hedge)

**Translation:** The smart money isn't just leaning Seahawks—they're backing up the truck. Meanwhile, Patriots positions look like insurance policies rather than conviction bets.

## Meet The Whales: 10 Traders Moving Markets

Let's put faces (well, wallets) to the data. These traders are moving serious money, and their strategies reveal how professionals approach Super Bowl markets:

### 🥇 #1: The Market Maker  
**[0xa61ef8773ec2e821962306ca87d4b57e39ff0abd](https://polycopy.app/trader/0xa61ef8773ec2e821962306ca87d4b57e39ff0abd)**

**Volume:** $2.26M | **Trades:** 4,425 | **Buy Ratio:** 52.6%

This is a professional HFT operation. With 147 trades per day over 30 days, they're clearly running automated strategies—buying at 67, selling at 69, capturing the 2% spread. But here's the tell: despite being market-neutral by design, they maintain a 2.6% bull bias toward Seahawks. Even the robots lean Seattle.

**Strategy Insight:** When someone making 4,425 trades shows ANY directional bias, pay attention. They see the entire order flow.

### 🥈 #2: The Patient Whale  
**[0x0b9cae2b0dfe7a71c413e0604eaac1c352f87e44](https://polycopy.app/trader/0x0b9cae2b0dfe7a71c413e0604eaac1c352f87e44)**

**Volume:** $1.70M | **Trades:** 384 | **Buy Ratio:** 46.3%

This trader has been positioned since **May 2025**—82 days of methodical accumulation. Their largest single position? **SELL Patriots Winner** ($555K). They're not hedging—they're actively shorting New England while collecting premium.

**Key Position Breakdown:**
- SELL Patriots Winner: $555K
- BUY Patriots Winner: $427K (hedge)
- SELL Seahawks Winner: $358K
- BUY Seahawks Winner: $263K

**Strategy Insight:** Classic long/short pairs trading. This trader doesn't believe Patriots win, and they've had 3 months to prove it. Follow their conviction.

---

### 🥉 #3: The Pure Bull  
**[0x6a72f61820b26b1fe4d956e17b6dc2a1ea3033ee](https://polycopy.app/trader/0x6a72f61820b26b1fe4d956e17b6dc2a1ea3033ee)**

**Volume:** $1.51M | **Trades:** 1,734 | **Buy Ratio:** 100%

Not a typo—**100% of their trades are BUYS**. Zero sells. Zero hedges. Pure, unadulterated Seahawks bullishness. With $250K in daily volume compressed into just 6 days, this looks like a whale who got a tip or has extreme model confidence.

If Seattle wins, this trader walks away with roughly **$900K profit**. If not, they lose everything. No middle ground.

**Strategy Insight:** This is either genius or insanity. The market will decide on February 8th.

### #4: The Balanced Professional  
**[0x7ba5354929bf388707f397c8b21b8322dc954252](https://polycopy.app/trader/0x7ba5354929bf388707f397c8b21b8322dc954252)**

**Volume:** $1.40M | **Trades:** 666 | **Buy Ratio:** 56.9%

The 666 trades (yes, really) suggest systematic position sizing and daily rebalancing. Their 57/43 buy/sell split shows mild bullishness while maintaining downside protection. This is what professional risk management looks like—never all-in, always balanced, consistently profitable.

**Strategy Insight:** If you're risk-averse, copy this approach. It won't 10x your money, but it won't zero you out either.

### #5: The Spread Specialist  
**[0x14964aefa2cd7caff7878b3820a690a03c5aa429](https://polycopy.app/trader/0x14964aefa2cd7caff7878b3820a690a03c5aa429)**

**Volume:** $1.14M | **Trades:** 479 | **Buy Ratio:** 96%

This trader has **$1.07M** concentrated in ONE position: **BUY Seahawks vs Patriots Spread** (SEA -4.5). They're not just betting on Seattle to win—they think it'll be a blowout. They want the full payout that comes with covering the spread.

**Strategy Insight:** Spread markets are where sharp money lives. This trader believes Seahawks win by 7+. That's a strong signal about expected game script.

### #6: The Late Entry Bull  
**[0x241f846866c2de4fb67cdb0ca6b963d85e56ef50](https://polycopy.app/trader/0x241f846866c2de4fb67cdb0ca6b963d85e56ef50)**

**Volume:** $717K | **Trades:** 363 | **Buy Ratio:** 90.6%

Entered the market just 21 days ago with overwhelming bullish conviction. **$543K on Patriots Winner BUY**—wait, what? This trader is actually betting ON the Patriots, not the Seahawks. They're one of the few contrarians with serious capital backing New England.

**Strategy Insight:** This is the FADE signal. When a sophisticated trader goes 90% long on the underdog this close to game day, they've spotted something.

### #7: The Pure Short Seller  
**[0x2663daca3cecf3767ca1c3b126002a8578a8ed1f](https://polycopy.app/trader/0x2663daca3cecf3767ca1c3b126002a8578a8ed1f)**

**Volume:** $701K | **Trades:** 5,105 | **Buy Ratio:** 0%

The most interesting trader in our dataset. **Zero buys. 5,105 sells**. They've been shorting Seahawks and Patriots markets for 89 consecutive days, collecting premium as odds tightened. This is a professional short seller betting against public consensus.

**Position Breakdown:**
- SELL Seahawks Winner: 3,359 trades, $363K
- SELL Patriots Winner: 1,746 trades, $338K

**Strategy Insight:** This trader believes BOTH teams are overpriced. They're either hedged elsewhere or betting on market inefficiency rather than game outcome. Respect the conviction—89 days of pure shorts takes steel nerves.

### #8: The Late-Stage Whale  
**[0xdc876e6873772d38716fda7f2452a78d426d7ab6](https://polycopy.app/trader/0xdc876e6873772d38716fda7f2452a78d426d7ab6)**

**Volume:** $503K | **Trades:** 71 | **Buy Ratio:** 100%

Only 71 trades but $503K in volume = **$7,084 average position size**. This is a whale entering late with concentrated bets. All buys, spread across 4 different markets. They're not market making—they're taking directional positions.

**Strategy Insight:** Large positions, few trades, 100% buy = someone with conviction entering at what they believe are favorable odds.

**Volume:** $467K | **Trades:** 4,901 | **Buy Ratio:** 58.9%

Nearly 5,000 trades over 154 days. This is someone grinding out small edges daily—**$95 average position size**. They're a retail trader who trades like a pro: high volume, modest buy bias, consistent presence.

**Volume:** $412K | **Trades:** 1,448 | **Buy Ratio:** 77.1%

Active across 3 different market types with healthy bullish bias. Not all-in like Trader #3, but clearly leaning Seahawks. Their **$126K BUY on Patriots Winner** is notable—they're hedging their Seahawks longs with Patriots upside.

**Position Breakdown:**
- BUY Patriots Winner: $126K
- BUY Seahawks Winner: $117K
- SELL Seahawks Winner: $85K
- BUY Seahawks Spread: $75K

**Strategy Insight:** This is textbook risk management. Long both sides, heavier on Seahawks, hedged with spread plays. Professional structure.

## The Contrarians: Bears Worth Watching

While most elites are bullish on Seahawks, these traders are swimming upstream with serious capital:

### Bear #1: The Short Seller  
**[0x2663daca3cecf3767ca1c3b126002a8578a8ed1f](https://polycopy.app/trader/0x2663daca3cecf3767ca1c3b126002a8578a8ed1f)**  
**$701K | 0% buys** (profiled above)

### Bear #2: The Zero-Buy Trader  
**[0x8e9eedf20dfa70956d49f608a205e402d9df38e4](https://polycopy.app/trader/0x8e9eedf20dfa70956d49f608a205e402d9df38e4)**  
**Volume:** $373K | **Trades:** 6,171 | **Buy Ratio:** 0%

Another pure short seller, even more active than Bear #1. Over 6,000 trades, every single one a SELL. They've been grinding away for 51 days, collecting premium and betting against public sentiment.

## The Bottom Line

After analyzing $26.6M in elite trader activity, the signal is undeniable: **smart money is heavily bullish on Seattle Seahawks** to win Super Bowl LX. 

But the 7 contrarian bears with $1.5M+ in short positions deserve respect. They're not degens—they're calculated traders betting real money against consensus. And in prediction markets, consensus is often wrong.

**Our Take:** Seahawks to win, but closer than the 68% odds suggest. Patriots +4.5 and UNDER 46.5 offer contrarian value.
